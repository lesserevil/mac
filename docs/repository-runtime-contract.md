# Repository Runtime Contract

Any repository registered with mac must declare how an agent prepares and
verifies that repository on a fresh host. The contract is intentionally
project-owned: mac should not guess that every worker has the same shell state,
package manager, Linux distribution, macOS setup, or WSL2 image.

The contract file lives at `.mac/project.yaml` in the repository root.

```yaml
schema: mac.repository_contract.v1
project: repo-beads-mac
platforms:
  - darwin
  - linux
  - wsl2
toolchain:
  required_commands:
    - python3
    - git
    - gh
    - bd
bootstrap:
  command: python3 scripts/bootstrap-project.py
  creates:
    - .venv/bin/python
test:
  command: PATH=.venv/bin:$PATH .venv/bin/python -m pytest
evidence:
  required:
    - repo.head_sha
    - repo.pushed
    - repo.dirty
    - repo.files_changed
    - tests
```

## Required Fields

- `schema`: must be `mac.repository_contract.v1`.
- `project`: must match the mac project name used when the repository is
  registered.
- `platforms`: explicit supported host families. Use broad families such as
  `darwin`, `linux`, and `wsl2`; document narrower distro assumptions inside
  the bootstrap script instead of assuming Ubuntu.
- `toolchain.required_commands`: commands that must exist before bootstrap can
  run. Keep this list small and portable. mac fleet deploy installs baseline
  worker tools such as `gh` and `bd`; project bootstrap scripts should fail
  loudly when a required command is still missing.
- `bootstrap.command`: an idempotent command run from the repository root to
  create the local build/test environment.
- `bootstrap.creates`: relative paths expected after bootstrap. These are used
  as a quick signal that a host has already been prepared.
- `test.command`: the canonical verification command for default task work.
- `evidence.required`: manifest fields a worker must include before mac can
  consider repo work publishable.

## Enforcement

The Beads bridge validates this file during repository registration and again
before every poll. Registration fails if the contract is missing, malformed, or
names a different `project` than the registered mac project.

Imported tasks carry the normalized contract in both the project item payload
and `task.metadata.origin.repository_contract`. The Hermes executor prompt
surfaces the contract and tells workers to bootstrap from the local checkout
before running the declared test command.

Direct tasks created through the task CRUD API are normalized too. If their
`project` matches an enabled registered repository, mac attaches the same
repository contract to `task.metadata.origin.repository_contract` and records a
strong `task.metadata.execution_contract`. If no repository applies, mac records
a weak `operator_directive` execution contract and emits
`task.execution_contract.weak` telemetry so under-specified work is visible
before an agent tries to execute it.

## Worker Checkout Rules

Repository work is not performed directly in the registered source checkout.
The worker prepares a task-owned git worktree and passes its path through
`MAC_TASK_REPO_WORKTREE` and `metadata.runtime.repository_worktree`. Agents must
commit, test, and publish from that task worktree, then report the pushed ref or
PR URL in `mac.worker_evidence.v1` evidence.

The registered repository path remains the durable project source used to derive
worktrees and to identify the runtime contract. It should stay clean in normal
operation. If mac detects dirty registered source state that affects bridge
polling or worktree preparation, it creates a source-remediation task for the
agent that owns that environment; ordinary feature or bug tasks should not edit
the registered checkout directly.

## mac As First Adopter

mac declares its own contract in `.mac/project.yaml`. Its bootstrap command is:

```bash
python3 scripts/bootstrap-project.py
```

That script first verifies `python3`, `git`, `gh`, and `bd`, then creates
`.venv` and installs the dev extra so a fresh macOS, Linux, or WSL2 agent can run:

```bash
PATH=.venv/bin:$PATH .venv/bin/python -m pytest
```
